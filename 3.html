    JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
    that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
    often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating
    third-party libraries. Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute
    the code on the user's device.
